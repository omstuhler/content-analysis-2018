"1"," I also think get the immigrants jobs as soon as possible, teach them the language. Cheaper Norwegian classes. Apprenticeship. Better access to more opportunities. Integration at school. How to do it I have no clue, though.","Immigration",37,225
"2"," I dont necessarily believe everyone will get out of here. I believe many will, but I think many will figure out that crime is an alternative. To commit crime in Norway is maybe not as bad as in the country they came from.","Immigration",44,225
"3"," Regarding immigration, there will be more. We cant do anything about that. When they come here its not by choice. They have a reason, but what I am mostly worried about are the extreme right-wings like we see in Sweden.","Immigration",41,225
"4"," Yeah.  Just to maintain skills.  You spend 15 years training somebody up and theyre in charge of a team, and its successful, then you dont want them to leave, do you?  Whos going to benefit from it?  So, the employer.","Gender",41,225
"5"," Thats the question, though. We dont have minimum wages in Norway, so it is the union that negotiates wages for their members and non-members who work with the same, to a degree. I dont have much insight into union work.","Gender",41,225
"6"," Always gender/common sense?16:10 involved in such decisions. What to emphasise? What happens all the time, right? One always has to hide behind that, be better that way, or specifically have more experience in that field.","Gender",36,225
"7"," What about working from home, then? You couldnt work from home in all professions, like nurses cant work from home. But in banking you can sit with your laptop, right. One has to stay updated and participate, but still.","Gender",40,225
"8","  But it's also about knowing what your priorities are. Is your priority your child or your job? If you intend to work until 9 pm every day, if that is the case, then there will be deprivation when it comes to up-bringing.","Gender",43,225
"9","  Like I was saying, the larger companies could certainly provide this. The ones that could, would get benefits, tax relief, all of it, all of it, all of it, medium and small companies, well, here, its a bit questionable.","Gender",40,225
"10"," I dont think its so much less for the young because theyre offering an apprenticeship, someones teaching them something. I think if you bring the younger generation then at 18/19 theyve got that experience","Generations",35,225
"11","But I think that Pia has a point in that if you have a lot of money then you should start by spending that. But of course you should then get your old-age pension once you've exhausted your resources and there's nothing left.","Generations",43,225
"12"," I believe that is one of our advantages in Norway, that we have higher education, and we might not be the cabin crew of the future, but the future that creates CEOnot CEO, but efficient solutions within aircraft, though.","Labour market",40,225
"13"," But all these payments the state collects for pension, you can take in that money, and then you have more in the fund. People would rather go spend money at Media Markt than invest money in retirement. Thats the problem.","Labour market",41,225
"14","  It's a fact that most employers hire through agencies. At least our company, we don't hire people by going to the Employment agency, requesting such and such occupational profile, we simply hire a private agency instead.","Labour market",37,225
"15"," I think things like university costing so much and individuals working full-time and not being able to go to uni when they quite easily be earning in that higher tax bracket and theyre not given the opportunity to do so.","Econ. Inequality",41,226
"16"," You cant have this incentive for parents to send their children to private school, because they believe they will get a better education there. Rather, they should be convinced that the public schools can also offer this.","Econ. Inequality",38,226
"17"," Or that a large firm suddenly says theyre moving to Ireland  many of them did that, even if it was only that they moved their headquarters there, because then they pay less in taxes. We still have this to a major extent.","Econ. Inequality",44,226
"18","  There's another problem, we are small. We are required to have the same military forces, the same equipment, as a country of let's say 60 million people. And we only have 2 million. And we still have to finance all of it.","Econ. Inequality",43,226
"19"," People are coming in and the UK has open doors for everybody, whoever wants to come here they just come in and thats about it. EU national   how many","Immigration",40,226
"20"," I think we should expect more migration in general and not be surprised, because were coming into a time of climate change, and as the environment changes, certain people will be displaced and need to live somewhere else.","Immigration",39,226
"21","  Then theyll all need support and social transfers, we should prevent that, to have as few of those that assimilate on social transfers as possible, that theyll contribute something to the society, a certain added value.","Immigration",37,226
"22"," Well, its two-sided . My wife and I, we both work 12 hours a day, and whoever gets home first makes dinner  I do it, she does it, she does laundry or however it works out. We both share the duties.","Gender",44,226
"23"," you know, what plans youve got for the future. I mean, Im 32 but by the time Im 50, I want my mortgage to be paid and things like that, so I think if you set yourself up properly, then when you do come to that 65, 70","Generations",49,226
"24"," If you think our youth have problems, imagine getting the immigrants who have been to war and come and work here. The ones who are really well off struggle, and the ones who suffer should feel even better? The logic fails.","Generations",42,226
"25","  State supervision. The ministry of labour and family should have the inspectors on field, who would be checking things, just as we mentioned on the subject of schools. Do any inspectors actually check schools? Which ones?","Generations",37,226
"26","  Thats right, after all, everything, because old age is more like, when you... I dont know, that time should be a bit more fulfilled, they dont have to worry about certain things, but could find themselves in something.","Generations",39,226
"27","  And youd want to live at home longer. Now, if you have high-quality home care, and affordable, subsidized, you can still be handicapped and you are able to live at home. Even if you cant cook for yourself or live alone.","Generations",42,226
"28","  I disagree with you, because were talking about 20, 25 years in the future, how it will be if the minimum wage is such and such, there are no jobs, how will they create these if they dont have it, currently no one does.","Generations",45,226
"29","  That means getting more people involved, so that they can be told what is good and what isn't, rather than for them to hear something and then those who try to actually do something are forced to give up and go elsewhere.","Labour market",43,226
"30","  To expand, with the help of job requirements, I don't know, economic activities with the experts we already have, in order to have new workforce available, so that we are able to guide, in order to have less unemployment.","Labour market",40,226
"31","  The agency does have an income, everybody receiving a pay check pays tax to the state, which means that the tax is collected automatically , not from those registered at the agency, and that is where the money comes from.","Labour market",41,226
"32","  Look, but, we would, we would still be working. Those who get 500 EURO a month do spend. They pay the electricity bill, the water bill, pay for things and something flows back into the state cash register that way as well.","Econ. Inequality",43,227
"33","  But its very important why the employers give minimum wages, because they see on the tax table that if they gave higher wages, theyd also have to pay higher taxes on all other costs. So the tax table needs to be changed.","Econ. Inequality",43,227
"34"," Yeah - there are two differences, the people who are trying to get away from war and then you've got the economic refugees who haven't really got a reason for leaving where they live except they want to get some more money.","Immigration",43,227
"35"," I guess thats what I thought about too. How to integrate everyone in society, but I dont either have a measure yet. But like we talked about earlier that everyone has to go to nursery school, that is a measure for example.","Immigration",43,227
"36"," Maybe just better or optimized recognition of their experience, because we have laws that are supposed to regulate that and which have helped out some of those people, but I dont know why it hasnt been implemented faster.","Immigration",39,227
"37"," This might sound a bit dumb, but you have to distinguish between those who are coming for economic reasons because its a banana republic, and those who are actually from refugee areas. And this assessment is not happening.","Immigration",39,227
"38"," But children are not the problem, its us. When I see statistics on TV about the acceptance of people, 57% of people are against this whole idea. So that means when I talk to my children, theyre hearing this stuff from me.","Immigration",43,227
"39","  If for example you bring a scientist here, the kind of scientist who could not be educated here or whose education would be too pricey, let's say, it is probably cheaper to import such a worker, if there is a need for one.","Immigration",44,227
"40","No, that would be boring. But as a male teacher in a female-dominated field, there are some rules with regard to abuse. You're never alone with a female student for example. But those rules have been put in place to protect me.","Gender",42,227
"41"," ...if they're not academic. The rationale behind that is, obviously, leave space, there's less disruption in the classrooms, so the kids that are academic can concentrate, because quite often, these children are disruptive.","Labour market",34,227
"42","It takes so long to get a disability pension that what you're saying is beside the point, and there's also a limit to how many can be granted disability pension each year. That's why there are so many people on social security.","Labour market",42,227
"43","  And the businesses or companies are faced with the problem of having to pay the expense. They can, the agency can get a worker straight away, because they have workers available, but businesses have to pay for the service.","Labour market",40,227
"44","  Or they work according to guidelines that were in effect 20, 30 years ago, that are now completely useless. I think that here, we could put paying back the costs of education in case you dont finish in a certain period...","Labour market",42,227
"45"," Child benefit should just go back to when you used to, when it first started that they usually just get for the one child, that's it and now you get ready for the two children.  If you did that with .","Econ. Inequality",44,228
"46"," Yes, but its not on about Amazon and stuff like that its on about Joe Blogs the plumber whos got four or five staff who hes got to spend an extra thousand pound a month on wages that he cant .","Econ. Inequality",44,228
"47"," And with regard to teachers, there are some whove failed in their studies and are allowed to work as teachers anyway because of the lack of teachers. I was shocked to find this out from friends of mine who work as teachers.","Econ. Inequality",43,228
"48","There's no need for a time-frame if you've paid 2 million in tax over two years. Then you're entitled to social security because to me that means you've contributed. And the person doesn't want to be on social security, do they?","Immigration",41,228
"49"," What if you had to paynot privatise schools, it's a free education, what if you had to make a contribution towards that, so you send your kid to school no matter how much you earn then you pay <a3>25 for them to go to school?","Gender",46,228
"50"," Recognition of childrearing or something like that. I would call it family management at home, because when you have four children and three days of work per week, but you have to manage a sort of family business in a sense.","Gender",42,228
"51","  So that employers can decide, because they are no longer so likely to employ men, but perhaps Because they won't be certain of who is to take the maternity leave. It's apparent about the women, but not the maternity leave.","Gender",41,228
"52"," My children are in private preschool and school, and its definitely better. The teachers have fun with the students. In one of the situations, the teachers speak English with the students, and the teachers come from London.","Generations",38,228
"53","  The other day I actually asked the director of the elderly home why is it that he hired young and handsome waiters, who were serving the elderly and he answered, hang on, the majority of our residents are women, are female.","Generations",42,228
"54","  they don't manage it in a profitable way. If a land owner, who keeps an eye on his land so that it brings profit and does not let it decay, so that the business grows. Management of the funds we contribute into seems to me","Generations",46,228
"55","  Their pension plus subsidy, which isnt limited. If the nursing home costs EUR 1,300 the subsidy would be, if they only have a EUR 400 pension, the subsidy would be EUR 800. Not like it is now, a subsidy limited to EUR 400.","Generations",44,228
"56","  working for it or voluntary, do something voluntary. The last choice is in the services.","Labour market",40,228
"57","I don't agree that inequality is a problem. It's only a problem if the poor get poorer. The richer can get richer, that's not a problem. I'm very surprised at the figures we've seen. For example that the decile limit is only 379.","Econ. Inequality",43,229
"58"," I just think in 2040 what are the chances of the NHS being staying anyway, it should be privatised anyway, so you are going to have to pay for your health - well like if you are ill it's going to be private probably won't it.","Immigration",47,229
"59"," Theyd be able to coordinate this. The school classes after a half year of these welcoming classes, do they have to be three-tiered or four-tiered? Or five-tiered depending on how many come? All of that is completely unclear.","Immigration",39,229
"60"," By 2040, well have a completely different identity. Many people are out on the streets yammering about culture and how we have to preserve this, but what is there to preserve? The Musikantenstadl or the pork hock for dinner?","Immigration",40,229
"61","You need to be a resource, not just be seen as a resource, before you're entitled to welfare services. I'm not in favour of Polish workers being entitled to child benefit from day 1. No, because their children are back in Poland.","Immigration",42,229
"62","  Women are also less concerned about not seeing their child too often, to see her baby only for half an hour, an hour and then and an hour in the evening, or something along these lines. Because she is able to come in during","Gender",45,229
"63","  Yes, it's available. But if they demand that you stay at work late enough to finish this and that, you need to leave the child, you won't leave work just because of, you will find another person to pick up the child for you.","Gender",45,229
"64","  Let's forget about the homes for the elderly here, not every one is in one. Yes, even people at 85 are not necessarily in homes. The minority might be, but some are still very active, and could still do a lot of things, but","Generations",45,229
"65"," I thought about those with petty problems. The hindrance to enter working life isnt really that big. But today it is very simple. Society wants them on benefit because that is easier than to deal with it. Easier to just pay.","Labour market",42,229
"66","  educational class for people who went to studies.  What about people who are not going to university?  These people are just going to stay at home, do nothing and theyre just going to be low income earners.","Econ. Inequality",40,230
"67"," You learn more words when you go to nursery school, I mean you learn If you are home you learn perhaps 2000, but in nursery school you learn four to five thousand words. Then you have a better foundation when you start school.","Econ. Inequality",44,230
"68"," Can I just say about ID cards, another thing about ID cards is that obviously theyll be holding a lot of information and as we all know fraud as it is, who would monitor it and also it's very complicated to set up an ID card.","Immigration",47,230
"69"," You know, sod the people who say I don't want my photo on these, it's, you know, big brother is watching us.  Every other country that I've ever been to they have ID cards  why are we so different that we shouldn't have them?","Immigration",46,230
"70"," I was really shocked. Were partly from Turkey, and then when I hear these kinds of comments, like that they should go back where they came from and so forth. If my own kids are thinking things like this It really shocked me.","Immigration",44,230
"71"," There could be a rule for that, so that you get a part of that for the person youre caring for, but not that it could replace your job. If I look after my mother until she dies, and then maybe I dont want to work after that.","Gender",49,230
"72","  Also, when people start a new job, they would not be looking for a female or a male profile only, but it would be acceptable, and the employer would not have made his or her mind made up in advance about which gender to hire.","Gender",46,230
"73","  On one side, sick leave is being taken advantage of, on the other, theyre sending half-ill children to the kindergarten. The mother should have the option to take sick leave for 14 days until the child is completely healthy.","Gender",40,230
"74"," The age, before, it was 55, and now it's 65, so I think we should have a policy in place, and perhaps, keep it to 65, perhaps, and not increase it.  Simply because it's like, you're working all your life, and you deserve that.","Generations",45,230
"75","  Can I just add something to this, about what the madam suggested, it would be useful to learn how much, how much this extra day would bring into the budget, I mean, the January second, which is no longer a holiday, and so on?","Generations",45,230
"76","  And not that you have trips and such organized, cooking, that you can cook better, that you see what else can be made, not just this Slovenian food, beef broth and meat and I dont know what else, something in that direction.","Generations",43,230
"77","  Intergenerational connections, you know, if the elderly person stays, they transfer everything to the younger ones. And then the younger person sees that theyll be old at some point. And then you have two, three generations.","Generations",37,230
"78"," Yes, right, but most people who work t the grocery shop counter have collective wage negotiations, they dont have their own wage negotiation. You get the wage that is set, thats what you get. There isnt much influence there.","Econ. Inequality",40,231
"79"," And provide more focused support for teachers, because its not necessarily an easy profession, so one needs to address them. Some schools have had to close because of teacher strikes, because of how the teachers are supported.","Econ. Inequality",38,231
"80"," Difficult to specify it, but important to get people into work. Reach integration through that. I think it is difficult to know how to do it. It is a problem that immigrants dont get jobs. It is about investing in integration.","Immigration",42,231
"81"," But how are you supposed to teach little children that you cant see them as a threat, when some of them are threatening. You cant teach them that half are good and the other half want to do you harm. They cant differentiate.","Immigration",44,231
"82","  But with the condition that she comes back and works here. However, the state does not commit itself to find her a job, but she needs to find one by herself. If she does not manage to find it, she will have to repay the money.","Immigration",47,231
"83"," When they apply for a job, they couldI dont knowdo you know how in an interview they could do it so its likeI dont know how they would but that the person doesnt see what gender they are. I know thats a bit strange but","Gender",46,231
"84","  Today it's a long way from publishing a job advertisement to actually hiring a person, if a person is being employed. Advertisement needs to be published, then get, it takes a long time, it's not so simple with a new employee.","Labour market",42,231
"85"," Yes, sort of. The state can say This is the limit Not that they shouldnt get paid, it is a lot of responsibility and work, but it should maybe be a limit. The profit could go to those who are a little under? That is more fair.","Econ. Inequality",48,232
"86"," What is the difference between the eastside schools and the westside schools? It is on the westside most Norwegians live. And there its just..30:28? Then they start school at different levels, some speak Norwegian, others dont.","Econ. Inequality",37,232
"87"," Education sounds very nice in a setting like that, but do we really believe that more education will lead to reduced wage inequalities? Dont we believe that somebody had to do the jobs where higher education isnt valuated too?","Econ. Inequality",40,232
"88","  Another thing, perhaps a person, who is now a recipient of transfers and does not wish to work, would get the idea, hang on, if the minimum wage is a little higher than what I get with the transfers, I should perhaps get a job.","Econ. Inequality",46,232
"89"," It is in place but the government is not actually following those rules because whoever is coming to the UK as an international has three months to get work.  If youre inactive within three months you should leave the country.","Immigration",41,232
"90","  My friend too, when she was hired, she was asked if she is planning a family, or already has one, if she has any children. She was already asked about everything. When are you planning, are you planning it in the next 10 years.","Gender",45,232
"91","I don't see how this kids thing could work for me, neither personally nor financially. Most people I know use this argument for not having children: 'I'm still in education, I don't have the economy or the career yet to be able to'.","Generations",43,232
"92","  Also raising awareness regarding high-quality old age in the sense of taking care of your health and taking care of your mental stability. Something like that. That theres quality of life, not only depending on finance, but...","Generations",38,232
"93"," The reference to appropriate pay means that the inequality is addressed to some extent. Last time we talked about the baker and how they should get a better wage, maybe not as high as a doctor, but is that what is meant by this?","Labour market",45,232
"94","  Towards the state and towards the company. And then also that. You get more ideas if youre loyal, you can present the new ideas to your boss, contribute to improvement. Here, I also see the possibility for certain advancement.","Labour market",40,232
"95"," I personally think in 2040 unfortunately theres going to be no NHS so I think if youve been here a month, two months if you need to go and see a consultant I think you should be paying anyway and that goes for anybody, really.","Immigration",46,233
"96"," To have a plan concept like we do when there is a natural catastrophe, how to evacuate people, for instance with earthquakes, theres a plan B. What happens if all of a sudden theres suddenly 100,000 people standing at the door?","Immigration",42,233
"97","  That's right, I mean, it's only an upgrade. But then things can take a funny turn, such as quotas in politics, where they look for 5 women politicians to fulfil the quotas. The other aspect, where there tends to be exaggeration.","Gender",42,233
"98","  Another concern. I dont know how this is defined at all here.   76:  Public/private, whatever. We said night kindergartens. But isnt it like that, that if you have a child, the employer cant put you on the night shift at all?","Gender",42,233
"99"," I want to make a comment, and that is that I very much disagree with my female neighbour regarding agriculture. She awakens the Centre Party member (Political party supporting farmers and agriculture) and farmers daughter in me.","Labour market",38,233
"100"," But those who have money to spare, they do take care of this though. But for most people, theres no possibility to put anything away for retirement, because they have a hard enough time paying bills from month to month as it is.","Labour market",44,233
"101","The biggest problem is wage increases, right? If wages increase by 2% for both high and the low-earners then that makes a big difference and this is why inequality increases. So I don't know, perhaps we should regulate wage increases.","Econ. Inequality",40,234
"102","There must be a limit. We can't say to people that there is a chance they might get sent home at any point, even if they have put down roots and bought a house. That must only apply for a certain number of years. 6 years, I would say.","Immigration",49,234
"103"," Well, Im looking to see if I can include it here somewhere. It could go under equal treatment, yes. There. Universal acceptance and validity of the equal treatment of men and women in general. It falls under that category for me.","Gender",42,234
"104"," My wife can work from home. They came to our home to check whether we had everything set up according to regulations with windows, ergonomic chair, just like in the office, and then she is allowed to work for three days from home.","Gender",44,234
"105","Considering that this society that has the largest number of well-educated women I think women need to able to stand up for themselves too and obtain working conditions, both at home and in the labour market, which give them equality.","Gender",40,234
"106","  By yourself, you could have done many things with the money, throughout your life. And why should the person who goes in retirement, or has been retired for one year, 5 years, 10 years, some do not even make it to the retirement","Generations",44,234
"107"," It also has to do with mobility. NAV approves of peoples places of residence even though they know there arent any jobs there. It should be stricter, like Okay, so there arent any jobs on the west coast. You have to move then","Labour market",44,234
"108","  No, this should be done during schooling, for example as a summer job or, I don't know, compulsory work experience, as we have been mentioning before. If the company can immediately see if the person is right for this job or not.","Labour market",43,234
"109"," There is one point I want to make about this, the tourists coming to this country and getting free NHS, they shouldn't be made to pay in the future for treatment and that, in the hospital and that.  They are coming for a holiday...","Immigration",45,235
"110"," absolutely so if they contribute welcome them in.  I mean to us weve always had that policy in England where weve let x amount of people in to do x.  As long as theyre working and contributing to the society theyre living in.","Immigration",44,235
"111"," In terms of the infrastructure why not put for example one or two per cent more tax on new coming immigrants.  So if you come in you pay not 20 but 21 per cent of tax and this one per cent is going towards building infrastructure.","Immigration",47,235
"112","  Id strictly determine the countries from which well be taking the immigrants, not just any, not from Afghanistan or thereabouts. Id take more civilised nations, because this culture needs to be on the level of European culture.","Immigration",38,235
"113"," I believe the thing about pension is still lingering. To actually accept in organisations that the father takes six months of parental leave and gets accept for doing it. I believe that is important to increase the number of women.","Gender",41,235
"114","It exists, that's for sure. But couldn't you, moderator, also include the issue of men and women being equal in the eyes of the law with regard to custody of children. Can't you sort of summarise that into one point in some clever way?","Gender",44,235
"115"," Someone is saying credit cards and everything, its caused the downfall of Greece, actually, when they introduced them. Thats why theyre in the mess theyre in, is what the people are saying on the news when theyre interviewed.","Generations",39,235
"116"," I think the private ones have stronger ideologies that meet some people more, but I dont know if it has anything to say for the children, really. Not as much as they like to advertise it to the parents. Thats what I believe though.","Econ. Inequality",45,236
"117"," Because it wouldnt change this gap at all. If everyone had an extra 1,000 euros, it wouldnt change the wealth gap. Its just a calculation trick. Everyone gets the 1,000 euros, including the millionaires, and then nothing changes.","Econ. Inequality",39,236
"118","  That's the case in America, the American system. People there work, they spend all their time working and don't have any time left to think, once you do nothing but work, the money is accumulating and there is not time to spend it.","Econ. Inequality",44,236
"119","  Consequently, the parental leave would also be higher, not like now, like I found out that all of a sudden, 100 % fell to 90 % of parental leave. I dont know, for a couple of months, you get the 100 %, one, two, three, but then...","Econ. Inequality",48,236
"120"," In selective grammar schools you do, because it's based on their academic ability, so they could come from really deprived backgrounds, but a very bright child can still get in there, so you're getting all different social classes.","Gender",39,236
"121","  Or, if I may give an example, car mechanics, they are predominantly men. And if a man and a woman may run for the job of a car mechanic, and the woman may happen to be much better at it, but it's still the man who will get the job.","Gender",51,236
"122"," No, but hand in more applications, but then at least you get an interview as a reply, that you are fit for the job, or its not somethingat leastlets say you send 50 interviews, you send 50 applications..at least you get a reply.","Labour market",44,236

What can we learn from the ones who come here, their values, their experiences, way of life? So that we can have less prejudice against differentness than today. That is my request for the politicians, to figure it out and advise their people.","Immigration",116,676
"1437","We're moving towards a paradigm shift when it comes to technological development. We've always been told that machines are taking over our jobs but it hasn't happened yet. We're still validating our ability to work with regard to productivity... I think we will see the way in which we contribute to society in terms of work change radically. Not with regard to machine development but with regard to our land resources. In 2008 we experienced an iron shortage for the first time ever. Our raison d'<ea>tre as the world is under threat. I believe in the idea of global unity. The nation state of Denmark will be depleted because we can't sustain it with respect to the labour market.","Labour market",119,680
"1438"," I remembered another thing that hasnt been mentioned much. It is very important that one is including the people who are left outside the working life due to health- or social reasons. The way the system is today, there are many temporary arrangements, but little permanent arrangement. A great deal of the ones on social security have permanent reduced capacity. They wont get well again. There are many measures for adapting for a period, but little long-term. More focus on permanent measures. It is kind of applying for disabled, but specifically the way the system works today, there are no good, permanent measures. It is important to include people in the working life.","Econ. Inequality",114,682
"1439","It's hard because there are many prejudices about those who come to Denmark. I'm talking about immigrant and not refugees. I think Michael is right when it comes to contributing, but you can contribute in ways other than strictly economically. We need to have a dialogue where we ask people what they plan on contributing. It's wrong to throw them out after a week. Our society is rich enough to be able to process cases based on certain criteria. Those who have examined the relevant requirements in the country aren't necessarily coming here with a job offer but on the basis of education. It's difficult to put a limit on the processing time, which is why it should be graduated.","Immigration",120,682
"1440"," I agree with 25. I dont think thats a big problem toward 2040 either. But it is a problem that it creates jealousy.  People compare too much. Forget these examples, I dont believe they are a problem, but in the state in general, within the public, the difference between the leaders there. Executive officers have increased (the wage) a lot over the last years. This leads to bad blood quite frankly. The argument is that we have to take of our leaders, but in real life no leaders go over to the private, as good as zero. Solution: less increase and inequality between management and executive officers in the public sector. This creates friction and I know a whole lot about it.","Econ. Inequality",123,687

But then, thats the individual losing out, if the company are legislated that they have to be able to provide that ten weeks, then that individual can say, actually, yes, Ill do it, Ill work 40 hours the first week, 36 for the next two, phase it out, and then they earn up to that 100 per cent.","Generations",139,688
"1442"," I see really big challenges in the years to come. We dont control it, but the international situation controls it. With the wars we face in the world today, many people will come. We have been through this period, but in a much smaller scale, so we do know what works and what doesnt. One of the problems today is that refugees, asylum seekers are stowed away all over the country. We have to have a bed for them to sleep in, but they arent allowed to work in the waiting period before their case is considered and they are placed in the municipalities. I believe we have to put in great recourses there and actually let them work. Stronger measures for temporary residence permits.","Immigration",126,689
"1443"," I dont know. With these topics I find it difficult to relate to an unknown number of years ahead in time. With the other topics, you have a certain idea about where we stand some years from now. But with this, the situation has proven to change rather rapidly. I think this is the most difficult; to relate to something I dont know how is going to turn out. I am very hesitant. The extensive term integrationas measure then, one has to use resources on integration. Im not sure what is more expensive, spending money on integration or say that they should integrate themselves and then defray the cost in hindsight. My attitude is that maybe it pays to invest in doing things right.","Immigration",125,690
"1444"," The way the global situation is today, people flee from war and violence and they can be quite traumatized. I believe it is important to work with peoples health and people who have experienced trauma. Talked about a higher degree of violence amongst the immigrant population. I believe some of it can be a result of much aggressiveness. If you are brought up on violence and war and know nothing else, then it can be easier to turn to violence yourself even though you are living in peaceful surroundings. Quite simply treatment of trauma and experienced violence is important. Especially when we see that the immigrants are people who fled for their lives, fled from war and violence.","Immigration",119,691
"1445"," What you say is well put, with immigration follows learning both ways. But it is also so, that when you immigrate to something, you chose that culture that you immigrate to. I believe the essence is to begin with language. Teaching language in order to teach culture. Experience that this is related to both rights and duties. When you enter a society you get some rights, but you get duties too. We have to make sure that they understand what that implies and that it is followed through. For example get a job, learn the language, achieve to enjoy. My first specific advice is the language. Intensify and provide that language teaching as soon as possible to ensure the cultural teaching.","Immigration",122,694
"1446","I just came to thinking...that as we're talking about this now...we're saying there should be a limit. I.e. if they can integrate and the children go to school and all that. I think that we should think outside the box a bit and spends some more money in order to achieve regular case processing. If it's about children who go to school then we involve teachers. If it's about people who are in work then we involve co-workers. So we sort of assess whether or not we're dealing with a person who we believe should remain here. There should be some form of limit because we have to be able to offer people some security with regard to the future. So what I'm suggesting is more nuanced case processing.","Immigration",129,701
"1447"," The discussion is about wage inequalities so one presumes there is something called wage then. Then you receive wage and it has to come from somewhere. To be able to wage to a working life, that we connect professions it pays to work. It is important (Im sorry. This section didnt make sense in Norwegian so it is translated word by word) I want to strike a blow for vocational work, to actually be allowed to be a carpenter and a bricklayer that dont need preliminary training school. Raise it to a wage level. That type of profession is useful. Those are hands we need too. Education is important too. We lack something there, in actually making sure that they get jobs that have these skills.","Econ. Inequality",127,702
"1448","  What we now know as labour legislation, should be aired through and through, I totally agree. But there should also be, in har silly term, but still, in harmony with the social welfare. Because protection and such for workers, to shove this into the labour, is very bothersome. Here, the state should oversee the aspect of welfare, which absolutely falls out, which drifts through a sieve, needs to be intercepted with a certain net, and then we would have social welfare. And not to labour, don't shove it back, back to the employer, who does not like the worker, doesn't want to engage the worker, in order for the worker not to cause damage, but let's go back to the if you don't work, you don't eat.","Labour market",128,709
"1449"," I have two, not really measures, more something I believe, which is that the pension age will go up. That is because I believe people want to work longer and because we get older. Peoples health is better now, better healthcare than what we had before, so we have better conditions for working longer. The second thing is that I hope and believe that we have become more aware of our own pension, so that we are better equipped when we reach pension age.  That we have saved up for our own pension. That we get through it. Only an assumption, but it has gotten a lot of attention the last couple of years. Hopefully they learn from it, but it isnt a measure, but it has been a lot of publicity around it.","Generations",135,710
"1450","I think it's important to distinguish between refugees and immigrants. We can require immigrants to be self-supporting. When it comes to refugees it might be possible to tighten up the rules relating to permanent and temporary leave to remain significantly. If you have been here for 5 years because your country's been at war then we should be able to send you home once the country isn't at war anymore, even if it's been a number of years and you've had kids here in that period. Whether or not you send the entire family back depends a little on whether the children are in the final stages and can manage on their own in Denmark and if they've always lived in Denmark, then ok. Otherwise it's the whole family.","Immigration",129,715
"1451"," And, women put their careersa lot of women put their careers on hold to have a baby.  So, they stop then bettering themselves at work.  I climbed to a certain position and then I had a baby and I had to wait then a few years until he was at school before I could then start pushing myself again, because my husband earned more money.  So, he carried on and did that and I did my job, full time, but also looked after the children.  So, I stunted my ability to work more, because I wanted to, because I wanted a family.  I've got a friend who has done it the other way round, shes gone on to further her career and it's her husband that stops at home.  Shes now on the board of directors at a very big company.","Gender",142,715
"1452","I would like to follow suit because, as Jacob said, of course it's unfair that a director should get a golden handshake worth millions. Because naturally it's just as bad for a worker to lose their job as it is for a director. An nursery educator has an insane amount of responsibility when it comes to looking after our children; the future of society. Conversely, I know that the Director of Novo gets 25 million a year. And that's fair. Not only does he make money for shareholders but he also creates jobs by making sure that the company continues to evolve and that there's research etc. We can't, in order to get back to what was said in the plenary session, look at figures alone. You have to look at it holistically.","Econ. Inequality",133,724
"1453"," I think differently than you, but I support all of you. We should have better state schools in the future so that all children, regardless of which family they come from, have the same opportunities in education to get the right start in life. I feel that is the governments responsibility. They can stimulate Girls and boys, no matter what economic family they come from. That they have the same opportunities and better opportunities in the future. That leads to the need for better educated teachers, in order to have that opportunity. I also think that the low-paid jobs should be stimulated more and have a wage increase if possible. Why should top management get millions? Is that right? What do they do with all the money?","Econ. Inequality",128,734
"1454"," Not very much, no. In general, maybe it is better that we dont have too big wage inequalities in our country. The measures then are what have been mentioned. I think prevention in schools and maybe as early as nursery school if one sees domestic challenges or learning difficulties or whatever. I also think we should increase the measures so that the disabled can work, at least gradually or maybe fully working to even out wage inequalities that way. Then it is to keep the support for education today because competence and education set the foundation for what to expect and what to get from the working life. I also think that if we could increase the pace of innovation in this countrybecause we arent too good at that now.","Econ. Inequality",131,737
"1455","  We already have a ton of workers registered at the Employment agency, well they are financed from somewhere. If these could be returned back to the market, if there were somebody to hire them, somebody who would say, OK, I need you for 3 months only, now that there is high season, and the worker would go and work for the 3 months, the way things are now, they basically can't. I mean the employer can hire him, but it, the procedure to arrange it takes 3 months to employ somebody for 3 months. The employer can't simply say, I need a person straight away, I need somebody in 2 days and perhaps may no longer need the person in 2 weeks' time or a month. For, if the person proves him or herself, he or she will stay on for a long time.","Labour market",145,742
"1456"," Affirmative action goes both ways, in theory. It is about idealizing society a little. The sexes are different and people have different interests. Cant force the idealistic society on people. It is maybe more common in education, affirmative action. Reservations for girls at boys educations and for boys at girls educations. It has been tried out, and I think we should have faith in the ones who start studying, that they study what they want to study. OK, so there might be a certain gender inequality in occupations, but then treat the occupations equally rather than taking affirmative action. That is beginning in the wrong end, forcing people to become something we hope to see parted down the middle. Society isnt that simple.","Gender",124,743
"1457","My girlfriend is 28 years old and has been with me for 10 years. It's not fun for her to have to write that on a job application. Every time she considers how much she should mention me, because many would find it inconvenient that she might want to have children at some point. I think it's an awesome idea to reorganise parental leave in some way. One thing we could try, to sort of take the burden off the workplace, could be to create a shared parental fund which would be 100% funded to a greater degree. That way we could at least attempt to remove the financial burden from the company. This is particularly a problem for small businesses. That way hiring a young woman who might want to have kids wouldn't be seen as an economic burden.","Gender",140,744

Norway has to dare bet economically and maybe go in for a couple of factories where they only make shoes for example. Lets say the profit isnt only in pounds and pennies there and then, maybe they run with a loss, but the most important thing is that the ones who receive social security and benefits work, and have to show up to receive the benefit. Again, someone might thing OK, I get only 14<a0>000 in benefit, maybe I should get an ordinary job? It should motivate to work and to find a job.

"1460"," If I should support one of the things already said, have noted the three most important. Education is mentioned many times, butresearch and development. A good example is the stem cell research, when it was peaking, the Swedish government granted tens of millions to make Sweden the leading country on stem cell research. They saw the opportunity of creating an industry. We had a certain party in the government at that time who thought that stem cell research was a sin, so everything just stopped. Despite the fact that we have very skilled groups in Norway, they arent always allowed to progress. We recently received the Nobel Prize of Medicine proving that we can, but sometimes I feel that the authorities limit it and that is not good.","Econ. Inequality",129,749
"1461"," Mm. I was at a meeting last week, and they worry more about right-wings than about a terror attack striking Norway. One thinks immigration and that the problem is the immigrants. But we also have to think about how we receive them. Give them the opportunity to work. There is racism in Norway, but luckily not so much compared to other countries. If an immigrant wants to apply for a job, he actually has to be given the opportunity to work too, if not we will only face even more prejudice, that foreigners dont work. It isnt easy to start working of you cant get a job. Many people try. One thing is the challenges when the immigrants come here, another is the challenge of what people think of them too. One has to be alert about that too.","Immigration",140,749
"1462","I would like to say that children are a burden on society, but only for a period of time. They're also the future and we'll have to invest in giving them a good upbringing so that they can contribute to society later. Parental leave benefits a great many areas, such as gender equality. The way it is now it's the mother who's the primary caregiver in the family. She's the one who takes maternity leave, stays home when the baby is sick, and as a result she gets a lower pension and becomes less attractive and gets pushed back in a large number of areas. And it seems a shame because there's a lot of talent potentially lost there. Just because she's biologically designed for pregnancy and childbirth that doesn't mean we should add extra restrictions.","Gender",136,755
"1463"," I believe that is one of Norways best qualities. The opportunities we have for equality. In terms of education, access to the labour market and opportunity to get a job, for young women today, not necessarily for those over 50, but almost completely equality in my opinion. The challenge is to keep that equality in the future. Regarding a measure, I believe flexibility in the parental leave and free distribution of it in the family, between mum and dad has to be absolutely prevailing. There has to be a minimum period for the mother, maybe also for the father, but at least a minimum of two months for the mother, but free to choose if one parent gets 12 months or the other gets ten plus two. It has to be free. I think that is the most important.","Gender",140,757
"1464","It becomes a problem if the inequality becomes too great because the poor get poorer! There's less distribution and the rich can decide everything in society; we see that happening in the US. There should be allowed to be some inequality, if it's based on production and value. Where it's gone completely off the rails is salaries. Back in the 70s in the United States, the richest earned 10-20 times as much as the poorest and now they earn 76 times as much. And on top of that they make completely absurd amounts off financial capital, based solely on speculation. None of the major companies pay tax. Differences should be allowed to exist in terms of production so those who contribute more are rewarded more. In the US the rich don't contribute to society.","Econ. Inequality",134,761
"1465","We'll stick to areas where we can legislate in relation to the recommendations. I.e., the fact that there are no bonuses in the public sector, but there are in the private sector. It's up to each business how they regulate it. We can't go in and legislate against people receiving a bonus if they get fired, or while they're working or how or where. So if we're to make a recommendation then we ought to stick to things which the government can influence. We should discuss the Danish model because tax is a very important part of this debate. If we're to ensure that the most disadvantaged won't be worse off then we need to look at the tax system and say well, there has to be a lower limit and it needs to be reasonable, to keep people above the poverty line.","Econ. Inequality",143,762
"1466"," I believe it is about attitudes in many ways. One has to begin adjusting attitudes somewhere, not necessarily label the moneybag. With many occupational groups at least. In many places that is where to begin, and then things emerge from that. More status for an occupational group, for example in healthcare. For some people that matters when they chose an occupation. Not the majority, but some people choose to work with something they dont really want to do, only because it is high status to have just that position. Im not saying we should take measures against it, but that we have to start somewhere with attitudes and not only decide on a wage scale specifically, and how much tolerance Thats what makes it so difficult to suggest specific measures.","Gender",131,764
"1467","  Let me put it this way: what we were saying earlier about the sole proprietors. It used to be that sole proprietors were benefiting from subsidies, but they were thrown on the labour market and most of them went bankrupt. Because they did not have the appropriate background knowledge, and support. I did however once read a survey, which showed that Slovenia has a very low share of self-employed persons. In Czech Republic and in Poland 80 % of young people wanted to open their own business, or do something independently. In Slovenia the figure was about 20 %. We didn't have such ambition, perhaps because of the negative experience, but the state should have provided some kind of support, which means a lot for people who are trying to look for an opportunity.","Labour market",135,772
"1468","  I have an example, when we once needed a worker for a, for a very demanding job, and we needed the hire one man to start working in 2 days. We turned to the Employment agency and asked them to send us 10 applications from people you think would be appropriate to do manual work, but they would need to start in 2 wee, in 2 days. They told us that it was impossible. That we need to send them a request and wait, that the request needs to rest at the agency for 1 week and only then they would send the requests. And we told them that by the time they finish the procedure, the job we are doing will already be over. We said we needed a person straight away, for a 2 week job. Now, this very moment. And it was impossible. It was impossible as far as they're concerned.","Labour market",155,774
"1469"," More female leaders, parents should decide themselves, but I think the fathers should take a minimum period so that they dont get away with it. Some fathers maybe want to skip changing diapers and so on. A measure for the lowest: I have thought about immigrant women who have to work. It is a must. But I have also been thinking that we have to take women more seriously in rape cases, because we dont today. It is like <ab>He said, she said<bb>. I believe we should get better at that. But it could also be for boys, if they are the victims of that. Keep the offer for single moms regarding education and work. Just keep it because we are very good at that.

"1470","US studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between how powerful unions are and how high wages are. So the less the power the union has the lower the pay, in absolute numbers and not in relative numbers. There is a graph that shows that if the power of the union decreases then so do your wages. It's what we've seen happen in Germany. They managed to break the trade union movement with the result that there's now a group of people who work full-time yet are unable to support themselves. I cannot stress enough how much evidence there is to support that the stronger the union movement is, the better the labour market conditions and the higher the likelihood that you'll be able to support yourself. And that's why two persons who work full time can't afford food.","Econ. Inequality",141,781
"1471"," Yes, everyone should be allowed to be with the person they love regardless of where they are from. I only mentioned what my beliefs for the future are. You mentioned that there are immigrants who want to stay and immigrants who only stay for a while and then leave. Regarding immigrants, I believe that Norway has to make itself more attractive for immigrants with higher education. I know that people choose other countries because they know that they will be included in the working life much quicker in countries like Canada  they are really good. Norway is more sceptical of people, so people coming here with a doctors degree have to work at McDonalds. In hard times, only people who shouldnt be here cross the border, whilst all the skilled people disappear. We need them.","Immigration",137,785
"1472","  No, I am talking generally here. For example younger generation, who still go to work, and have an elderly person at home and they decide and put him or her in the home for the elderly, and then everybody starts talking, oh, they put him or her in the home, the mentality here is that the home for the elderly is the end, the cemetery. In general, all over Europe, home for the elderly is the natural step forward, nothing else. Plus, people are in the company of their peers, others care for them, you are able to talk to people your age, to peers, right  and then there are cases of grandpas ad grandmas still involved in care for the children and child care.

"1473","Also, it's far more interesting to discuss what we want to get out of family reunification. And it's much more interesting to discuss western vs. non-western family reunification. Do we want to offer people shelter from a refugee perspective? Everyone would like immigration to contribute something. And if they're to be able to contribute something then we have to do something along the lines of the US solution for Canadians. We're short on nurses so we'll make it easy for them to get residency, etc. We have that points system. In the US you need to prove that you can contribute something which nobody else in the region can contribute. That's a very interesting approach. What do we want out of immigration? If we're not talking about humanitarian efforts but about resources that is.","Immigration",134,791
"1474","  That's what the statistics are showing. Here, I can say, and I volunteered because of my personal experience. And the thing is, me and my husband both work for the same employer, but we do different job. We started working there at the same time, we have the same degree of education, but he, he got the chance of a better promotion much earlier, he is very capable, but in certain areas it is I who is more capable, but the promotion that he got was not made available to me, to me as a woman. And I have been noticing similar things with other employees, with assistants, university professors. Because being female means smaller chances of promotion. Perhaps this percentage share, I don't know if things are any better abroad, but I have to say that things in Slovenia are not perfect.","Gender",144,794
"1475","  Since our country is lacking certain profiles of people, for example in health care, and even our people are running to other countries, I guess  OK, I just mentioned health care as an example, there are probably other similar areas  we could possibly attract these profiles with, I don't know, benefit, bonuses, to come from abroad and work here. And by abroad, I'm not referring to northern countries, but the south and the Middle east. For example, do as Germany has been doing, but their system seems to have collapsed a bit, they wanted the Syrians, but are now getting everyone but Syrians. Syrians are actually very progressive, European-like, they have been very quickly accumulating in Europe, which is why Germany wants them, they are also educated, and they are quite educated.","Immigration",135,795

New Deal in America, everywhere, theyre... Ill say being on the labour market. Take those for instance, that are now unemployed, if they carried out more public works and get at least some pay... Like weve seen with these refugees now, it seems that they go and work without any issues, they were surprised at the Ministry of labour and social affairs. No resistance. They went to work, because those are public works. It counts towards their period of employment, I think they get approximately EUR 800, up to EUR 1,000, thats a fair amount, right.

And so that people are not afraid, or should I say, I know people, who have already fulfilled all the conditions to go into retirement, but refuse to retire because they are afraid of how they are going to make the ends meet with their pensions. And many of them have, I am not saying anything, loans or similar things, because we all know it is difficult to buy items that cost over 100 EURO with cash nowadays. And people drag on working, because they fear, because I don't know how much it is exactly nowadays. 60 percent, the best years  and for example, I for example working at the railway company, where people work nights, holidays, Sundays  and this does not go into the pension base, so the pensions they receive may amount to as little as 60 % of their pay checks.","Generations",150,798
"1478","The minimum old-age pension has stagnated now too. It shouldn't be linked to changes in income...sure we can limit the basic amount on a political level, because more and more people earn occupational pension throughout their whole lives. I don't think the old-age pension will be abolished...but it would perhaps be smarter to use the money from old-age pension...one of the graphs showed that a large percentage is spent on old-age pension. I was surprised that it accounted for so much. We could certainly limit it and say that those who need more should get more and those who don't need so much could maybe get the fixed amount. I think there will be adjustments when it comes to old-age pension. I don't know, I'm retired, but I think that's the direction things will take and it might be right.","Generations",140,801

People wont tolerate that some have everything and do nothing, whilst others work 24/7 and are left with nothing. At the casualty clinic we have people on the edge of the economical cliff, right? In Norway we sit and save up in funds. We find ourselves in a very privileged situation. We have to bear in mind that it might get too big. Will we see anxiety and demonstrations?

I say: They will need food, clothes and electricity. That's what they need. Money has no real value. This has got nothing to do with whether or not there will be enough money for the elderly. There will be fewer taxpayers to collect money from, but we will still need to take from the production. So we need to take money from the owners, from the production, to make sure that there's money for the elderly. People need resources. It doesn't have a damn thing to do with needing money for the elderly. Fewer people can't pay more, right?","Generations",153,819
"1481"," I thought that we have to be concerned about creating jobs for everyone. Everyone cant have a bachelors degree and a masters degree. Has to be jobs for the unskilled. Cant have a society only for specialized jobs. Most likely that wont work. I also thought about the immigrants, they too need jobs and should contribute to generate incomes. I dont have a specific measure. And I also think it is important to include more people than today in the working life. I especially think of minor mental illnesses and muscular I mean people who in reality could have worked had they received enough treatment, or if someone had done research on that disease or something. No wish to lower the social benefit for those who are really sick and need the safety net. Actually some of the important things I thought about.","Labour market",144,820
"1482","DREAM is an acronym created by some communication studies genius. I think it would be great if we focused more on creating frameworks capable of broadening opportunities. Then we might step away from the Danish model a little, where we ourselves establish all the minimum frameworks and let the trade union movement provide support. The downside of this is of course that there's a risk of people using only the minimum framework. The minimum wage in Denmark is 0. It used to be the daily subsistence allowance but then that was cut. I think we should introduce a statutory minimum wage. That would for example enable us to cope with the pressure of immigration associated with social dumping and so on, because there are some legal obstacles to being able to legislate with regard to the agreement as there's no minimum requirement.","Labour market",142,833
"1483"," Is it problems with wage inequalities or not? I believe it can create big problems after a while. The thing with Piketty and how the wealth piles up more and more with higher wages. Suddenly we might face great inequalities in society between those who have a lot and those who dont have much. I also believe that great wage inequalities can affect democratic processes too. One can buy oneself out of trouble for example. That creates more social disparities. One can buy oneself free from health issues, go abroad to have surgery and such. And with that it gets less for the rest. It can create social anxiety in the long-run, especially if it is polarized; that could get scary. My solution anyway is something with the tax model, to take the large tops. That they dont pile up, and maybe a progressive tax on the higher incomes.","Econ. Inequality",150,838
"1484","I'm not a fan of that type of planned economy way of thinking. Saying that we need x number of economists next year and that's the number that can get in. I think that we need to look more closely at research funding to see what interests people and then educate based on that. I think, seeing as you asked the question in relation to older and younger people, that there are a bunch of concession structures for the elderly which do not apply to those who are eligible for state education support, for example. And I've always found it confusing why, for example, J<f8>rn's train ticket should be so much cheaper than Jasmin's. I think that we should focus more on assessing whether there are some who have a limited income because they cannot maximise their income further. Why shouldn't they be eligible for the same concessions? I just cannot understand that.","Generations",153,860
"1485","As Jacob just said, saving on activation and job centres in general, almost shutting them down. Making sure that there's perhaps a computer system instead which keeps an eye on whether or not you meet the established requirements as you're supposed to. At the same time, if you get a job offer you need to take it. And if you don't take it then you won't be entitled to any more money. If it would mean you had to travel 90 km to get to work then of course you won't be forced to take it. But if you're not offered anything in your area then you will need to cast your net wider. Another thing; trade unions. I am actually in favour of them but I believe all political support should be cut. It's reprehensible that some are forced to support political parties which they are not members of. Some will say free trade union elections but that simply doesn't exist in many places.","Labour market",165,878
"1486","  I think that, regarding equalities I mean, I doubt it - we are now welcoming foreigners, and who the foreigners, Muslims are. And what is a woman to a Muslim? Half of a goat. Half, half of it, it says it all. But I am wondering at all the feminists, supporting everything. How they will justify it, when a person arrives and says you'll have to wear this and you have to stay at home, you are not allowed to work I don't know. The other day our Mufti said that in 20 years' time there will be predominantly Muslims in Slovenia. And that is why a mosque is being constructed in Ljubljana, so that they will have a place to pray, I mean, I am very sceptic about this. We do support some things and I am not afraid of them. And I don't feel bad about, if they are. Some of them are normal, some aren't. But I think that it's increasingly the ones that are not normal that are arriving.","Gender",174,888
"1487","I work with this and I've defined some of these things together with the Ministry for Employment and implemented these rules. A trade union needs to look out for its member's interests. If a trade union can identify ways of increasing wages then they must try to influence that in a positive way. If they can influence it by giving some money to a particular political party then it's because doing so supports their own interests. Not because they support the party. For example, when Venstre cuts the deduction that's in the union's interest. And the trade union has a stake in ensuring that the Government stays in power. It's a question of safeguarding the interest that the association, because it is an association with members and general assemblies, has been established to safeguard. And I think it's actually very legitimate to go in and say I've been put on this earth to do this.","Labour market",155,891
"1488","I've lived here for 15 years and I've experienced racism several times. I have a strong will, I live here because I like it here, it's a great country, I have a job and I have my children. We live in a free country, we must be allowed to express our opinions, but they aren't going to affect me and they shouldn't affect you. We're not the only ones with headscarves who are being subjected to this. Complete respect for Denmark, because I came from Iraq. That used to be a rich country. We had a lot of immigrants and they were badly treated even if they were Arabs like us and Muslim. The Emirates, one of the world's richest countries  everyone's an immigrant, nobody gets permanent residence or the same rights as people from that country. So in the Arab world Arabs and Muslims are not treated as well as they are in Denmark. But in Denmark we need to provide better opportunities for immigrants who want to contribute.","Immigration",171,925
"1489","So I'll write that the downside is a control function of whether the ability to work is a problem. Our rationale is that these countless assessments are a strain on the person involved and on society and, and that there should be an incentive for getting onto the labour market, and that getting onto the labour market has a value in itself and that it's good because it makes people work-ready. The second proposal: Social security for people under 30 should be state education support because it motivates people to get an education and to get into work. The third proposal is to highlight the value of being on the labour market. It doesn't matter what job you have or what you do. One practical example of something that could be done is this Tradesmen's Skills Fest. A Danish Whatever Championship. And then we arrived at social responsibility, because I struggled there. Do we want to keep the minimum wage in the agreement set-up?","Labour market",164,937
"1490","  I very much agree with everything being said here, it has to do with something we could call a vision of development. None of the governments, including the Whinny's one, had a vision of development. And that's the thing, if there is a vision of development, then there is also direction. In order to get there, however, let's be specific, you mentioned: subsidies for the sole proprietors and this and that, was made across. Came, took, waited for you to finish eating, died, case closed. No one asked you what your business operations are going to be, where you will perform them, how. The vision of development means that subsidies go to those sole proprietors that fit in the vision of development better than others. It does not mean that the others don't get anything, time may prove them important. But there should be some sort of proportion, there has not been so far. They got the 5 thousand and that's it. So it's a combination of guidance and the vision or a specific task","Labour market",176,990
"1491","Everyone's welcome in Denmark, if they contribute. On the other hand, it is a problem if we spend money on people who have a different social idea of the concept of contributing. This might be a utopian proposal, but one country that did something constructive in this area was the state of Israel when it was created. There they had these things called kibbutzim. When you move to the country you get sent to a kibbutz to live off the land you cultivate, whilst at the same time getting health care and education. We could, in principle, do something similar. People don't necessarily have to live in government-financed apartments. Let's build a kibbutz. If people don't want to contribute then they have to go out and plough the fields. There's space enough for it in Slagelse and the surrounding area. I like the idea because it also appreciates that everyone can contribute. Not contributing shouldn't be an optionunless you're disabledthey have to contribute, it's too easy not to contribute today.","Immigration",170,1006
"1492","I think that's a good point. A few years ago the City of Copenhagen created a Foreign House. The idea is that no matter what you need the municipality to help you with they can assist you, so that you do not need to go to the bank to open an account, etc. When I think of immigration I think a lot about what it is we want to get out of them. I think it's interesting, in that connection, to look at the concept of willingness to integrate and the current points system. I've seen some examples of highly educated people who aren't allowed to become Danish citizens because they don't have the time to become involved in associations to get the points they need. I could imagine that we actively went in and then discriminated a bit there, as we do with the old-age pension. We could say that if you have a certain level of education you'll get a bit of preferential treatment when it comes to the assessment. And that's precisely what we want to get out of immigration, isn't it? In others words, preferential treatment based on knowledge.","Immigration",193,1040
"1493","  Could be, that he or she will take it elsewhere, but it is also difficult elsewhere . Now it already is difficult, let's say, right. I remember what used to be happening in Italy - years ago now, I would say some 20 years ago, a man was building a house. He had a plan, but the house, I better not get into that. He had a plan to build a pool next to the house, but changed his mind, out of a principle, because he said - I'll immediately get a knock on the door from the Financial police, who will, and Italian Liras were still the currency at the time, and if they find a 5 lira fault in my accounts, that equals approximately one cent, I will have to pay a fine in the amount of the swimming pool. They have different legislation. And if somebody earns enough to be able to afford such luxury, he or she should pay more than someone who earns 500 EURO. I know it also depends on one's occupation. If one works as a manager, one earns more than a worker at the factory, you cannot earn to buy a yacht, but a worker does not earn enough to afford bread.","Econ. Inequality",211,1060
"1494","Here we have a situation where one's talking about social aspects and that we need understand each other while someone else is talking about money. Right now we're talking economic equality or inequality, we're talking about two different things. One's talking about the gap between the top and bottom, which mustn't become too large. Someone else is talking about being able to relate to the disabled. A third is talking about not milking the richest. I believe that there needs to be inequality. There needs to be an incentive to make us all want to contribute more financially. And people mustn't be punished through excessive taxation. Is needs to be the same as today; we have the top tax rate which dampens the max. I'm a big believer in that. Equally, I would like to elevate the bottom level so that people on the bottom can have a decent standard of living. The fact that there are multi-billionaires doesn't much matter. Our income distribution ensures that the weakest have a decent standard of living and those at the top shouldn't feel compelled to move their money.","Econ. Inequality",186,1079
"1495","When I talk about equality and inequality I'm not talking about a skilled worker getting a higher salary than an unskilled worker. I'm talking about the fact that we accept that the company director's job security is worth so much more that he needs to have a golden handshake worth 50 million, whereas an unskilled worker gets 1.5 times his monthly salary. I understand that skilled people must have higher salaries than non-skilled workers. We could compare it to this: I do same job as one other person. I'm better at it than the other person and that's why I get paid a little more. But why should I get 5 times more than someone who's just doing something in a slightly different way? The other thing is that when we look at this, it's not so much about wages as such but about these structures that say that if you're Dj<f8>f trade union person then you're entitled to a high salary. If you're unskilled then you don't deserve a job that pays a lot of money. It's extremely difficult to compare for example a teaching assistant, who is unskilled, to a lawyer who does various things and handles various cases.","Econ. Inequality",201,1112
"1496","Part of this thing about men getting paid more than women...they're not the only ones who can negotiate. Looking at it from a lifetime perspective, women have a tendency to become pregnant every now and then. At times that means that they need to stay home to look after the child afterwards, with the result that they don't get paid in that period. So from a lifetime perspective they earn less because of the physical differences between the sexes. And that could be a focus area. If people take a year of parental leave they will typically only get paid during half that time. They get statutory maternity pay for the remainder. Statutory maternity pay isn't pensionable, meaning they earn less and have less towards their pension. The discrepancy which stems from staying at home versus being on the labour market can be tackled in two ways. Either by forcing men to take paternity leave, which is interesting but not useful, or by earmarking parental leave for men, which would also make men connect with their young children. But I think that people who take parental leave should be compensated on a par with their salaries to a far greater extent, during the entire parental leave period.","Gender",207,1196
"1497","I agree that if we are going to have a good welfare system in 2040 then we need to view it from a different angle. It's important to keep the Danish labour market model and that there is a social safety net. We are very flexible compared to other countries and that represents a huge competitive advantage. We'll probably slaughter some sacred cows. What's productive? Danish agriculture is primarily environmentally damaging rather than productive. If we abolished conventional farming we would see a drop in gross domestic product corresponding to that seen during the financial crisis. It's not as crucial as back when we had this huge export. It doesn't have the same social value today. It survives on EU aid. We pay too much for our food today. We could lower the income of those at the bottom and maintain the standard of living, if we could buy food at world market prices...We shouldn't cling on to a dated labour market where we consume too much energy to produce goods...We export but it doesn't provide added value. The Danish labour market model is crucial to the welfare system as we know it. So we must look at our production in Denmark: how could it help, how should it be regulated?","Labour market",211,1199
"1498","Previously we talked about exactly that issue, about the focus on the economic aspects. What's interesting about welfare technology is that we're already seeing it today. They've created these special socks which older people are able to put on without help. So they don't need to go to someone's house just to help them put their socks on, meaning that we're saving in economic terms and there's one less person needed. On the other hand, when we talk about care personnel we're not talking about helping people put their clothes on, but about those who need real help in their everyday lives. I completely agree that we need to put resources into that but it shouldn't be in order to save money but to make sure that care professionals have time to do other things.  That way they'll be able to ask the elderly what they really need. It isn't necessarily just about caring for people who are sick but about caring for people on a human level. The City of Copenhagen did an experiment where they made staff and older people to test these socks, and other technology, in real life situations. That offers companies that have innovative ideas the opportunity to showcase their products and it makes care personnel available to elderly people.","Generations",215,1241
"1499","That you won't get anything from the state is a good starting point because then you save up and you're not dependent on anything, that I don't dispute. But the idea that there won't be an old-age pension for our generation is nonsense, because there will and the funds are being set aside quietly bit by bit. It's a discussion which ends with some sort of benefit for those who cannot be supported. I can't see any point in that at all because we already have a reform which finances it. I did the maths on when I'll be able to retire, and if we assume that the current age progression continues I'll be 72. But today it's easier to make savings tax-free which means that you defer tax payment until you retire. In other words, we are helping to fund our own old-age pensions.  I think the system will be fine but I don't buy that old Marxist way of thinking, that money has no value. I definitely think we can discuss the real value of money. However, I'm more interested in finding out how we're going to decide whether to put our efforts into older or younger citizens. I mean, increasing benefits for elderly people and removing money from education, research and state education support. Think again. Who's going to finance it in the future?","Generations",227,1247
"1500","I actually don't think that wages are the biggest problem. What I was thinking about was this thing of saying ""His job is worth more so he needs a golden handshake worth X million in case he gets fired."" The idea that his job security matters more. That's what I disagree with. But I actually think there's something which is more interesting to discuss here. My partner and I live in a cheap housing cooperative property. We sit there thinking 'shouldn't we wait 5-10 years to buy a house or an apartment'? A friend of mine saved up and bought an apartment in 2009 or 2010. They've made several million and been able to sleep well at night as a result. Having that type of asset allows you to grow it tax-free. And this thing about keeping the capital among a limited number of hands and sort of recirculating it in that way, that increases inequality as it's not possible to get the money out. Say I have a million in my account and someone else has 10,000. If I give the other person 10,000 then they will have doubled their money and I will have had a minimal loss. Income diversion. I think that's interesting. There are people who, between 2000 and 2010 or 2008, made huge amounts of money from property development. Why shouldn't that be taxed? We're talking about land tax and property tax. You could almost scrap that system and just start taxing property profits, and that's not unreasonable. That could be one way of creating more equality because only people who can afford to buy can make money from it.","Econ. Inequality",257,1516
