      "Georg Simmel (German: [ˈzɪməl]; 1 March 1858 – 28 September 1918) was a German sociologist, philosopher, and critic.\n",
      "Simmel was one of the first generation of German sociologists: his neo-Kantian approach laid the foundations for sociological antipositivism, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?',[2] presenting pioneering analyses of social individuality and fragmentation. For Simmel, culture referred to \"the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history\".[2] Simmel discussed social and cultural phenomena in terms of \"forms\" and \"contents\" with a transient relationship; form becoming content, and vice versa, dependent on the context. In this sense he was a forerunner to structuralist styles of reasoning in the social sciences. With his work on the metropolis, Simmel was a precursor of urban sociology, symbolic interactionism and social network analysis.[3][4]\n",
      "An acquaintance of Max Weber, Simmel wrote on the topic of personal character in a manner reminiscent of the sociological 'ideal type'. He broadly rejected academic standards, however, philosophically covering topics such as emotion and romantic love. Both Simmel and Weber's nonpositivist theory would inform the eclectic critical theory of the Frankfurt School.[5]\n"

Then we detail \"spidering\" or walking through hyperlinks to build samples of online content, and using APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, provided by webservices to access their content. Along the way, we will use regular expressions, outlined in the reading, to remove unwanted formatting and ornamentation.
